# chip8
My take on a CHIP-8 Interpreter. This is a practice project to dip my toes into emulator development.

## building
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```
## resources
The chip8 community, as well as the wider EmuDev community is fantastic. There are many resources and tools to help get beginners started.
